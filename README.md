# OnlineXBMToolkit
This web-based tool was designed for editing and converting images into the XBM (X BitMap) format. I developed it with [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/) and the [Vuetify component framework](https://vuetifyjs.com/) for a private project and now I wanted to outsource it as a standalone app. It has many bundled features compared to other xbm-editors.

# Demo
You are welcome to test and use the tool yourself under the [following link](https://miwied.github.io/OnlineXBMToolkit/).

# Features:

### Input-section
- Uploading image files (SVG, PNG, JPG, JPEG), which will be automatically converted to the xbm format considering the specified grid and image sizes

- Customize the image and grid sizes, with individual control over width and height, the lock button allows maintaining equal dimensions

### Edit- / preview-section
#### Edit-mode
- Manipulate the XBM array by clicking on the grid
- Shift the pixels (left, right, up, down)
- Rotate the image (left, right)
- Invert the image
- Clear the whole grid
- Undo and redo your actions
#### Preview-mode
- Visual representation of the XBM data ("readonly")

### Output-section
- Download the converted XBM file or copy the XBM array to the clipboard
- Formatted version of the XBM array which can also be manipulated

### General
- Responsive design
- User notifications

# Limitations
- Large grid sizes have not been taken into account in this application. The visualization may suffer as a result.
